DEC64: Decimal Floating Point

This library contains initial attempts to port the brilliant work of *Douglas Crockford* ML64 (Windows/Intel MASM assembler) to NASM (Unix Assembly)
and in the end to JavaScript.

This will allow broader usage in modern languages, such as those compiling to JavaScript, NASM, SIMD, asm.js or WASM (Web Assembly).

So far the `public` (function interface specs) and all uses of the `pad` macro have been removed.

Please continue using this guide:

[Assembly from masm to nasm](http://left404.com/2011/01/04/converting-x86-assembly-from-masm-to-nasm-3/)

Ideally we should be able to decompile using this [recipe](http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/10924/translate-assembly-to-c)
- [compile assembly to executable](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_assembly_online.php)
- [executable to C decompiler](https://retdec.com/decompilation/)

If we ever get to a working `dec64.c` file either manually or via decompilation we could use [require-emscripten](https://www.npmjs.com/package/require-emscripten)
to convert the `.c` file to a Node JavaScript `.js` file via [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten)
